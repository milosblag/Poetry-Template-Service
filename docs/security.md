# Security Considerations

This document outlines security measures implemented in the Hello World API and provides guidance on security best practices for deployment and usage.

## Implemented Security Measures

### Network Security

#### CORS Configuration

The API implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with the following features:

- Configurable allowed origins (defaulting to `*` in development, but restricted in production)
- Restricted HTTP methods (only `GET` by default)
- Specific allowed headers (`Content-Type`, `Authorization`)

#### Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks:

- Global rate limiting of 100 requests per minute per IP address
- Custom rate limit headers to inform clients about limits
- 429 status code returned when limits are exceeded

### HTTP Security Headers

All responses include security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Controls resource loading to prevent various attacks
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation)

In production, additional headers are added:
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` - Enforces HTTPS

### Container Security

The Docker container implements security best practices:

- Non-root user execution
- Read-only file system where possible
- No privilege escalation allowed
- Resource limitations to prevent resource exhaustion
- Multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

### TLS/HTTPS

Always deploy the API behind TLS (HTTPS) in production. Options include:

1. Terminate TLS at a load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy)
2. Use a managed service with automatic TLS (e.g., AWS ALB, Google Cloud Run)
3. Set up automatic certificate renewal with Let's Encrypt

### Authentication and Authorization

The current implementation does not include authentication. For production use, we recommend:

1. Implementing OAuth2 with JWT tokens
2. Using secure password hashing if storing user credentials
3. Implementing role-based access control for protected resources
4. Consider using an identity provider (Auth0, Okta, etc.)

### Environment Variables and Secrets

For secure handling of environment variables and secrets:

1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Use a secrets management service in production:
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Google Secret Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - Kubernetes Secrets
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Use minimal permissions for service accounts

### Network Security

Enhance network security with:

1. Firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports and IPs
2. Use internal networks for communication between services
3. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection
4. Consider IP-based allowlisting for admin endpoints

### Logging and Monitoring

Secure your logging and implement monitoring:

1. Avoid logging sensitive information
2. Set up monitoring for unusual traffic patterns
3. Configure alerts for security-related events
4. Implement audit logging for security-relevant actions

### Regular Updates and Patching

Maintain security through regular updates:

1. Keep dependencies up-to-date (use tools like Dependabot)
2. Regularly update base Docker images
3. Apply security patches promptly
4. Subscribe to security notifications for used components

## Security Testing

Implement security testing in your development workflow:

1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Use tools like Bandit for Python code analysis
   - Include security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

2. Dependency Scanning
   - Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like Safety, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency Check

3. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   - Test running application for vulnerabilities
   - Consider tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite

4. Container Scanning
   - Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like Trivy, Clair, or Docker Scan

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Compliance

Consider implementing additional security measures if specific compliance requirements apply:

- GDPR (for processing EU resident data)
- HIPAA (for healthcare applications)
- PCI DSS (for payment processing)
- SOC 2 (for service organizations)
